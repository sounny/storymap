- Connect account creation to "joining a geographic knowledge community"

---

### Module 2: Platform Tour
**Geographic Objectives:**
- Understand StoryMaps as a geographic communication tool
- Learn how each block type supports geographic narrative
- Recognize the importance of map positioning, annotation, and context

**Suggested Activities:**
- Show examples of geographic StoryMaps and identify block types
- Practice annotating maps to highlight geographic features
- Discuss how Sidecar blocks can reveal spatial progression
- Analyze how professional geographers use maps in their work

---

### Module 3: Hands-On Lab
**Geographic Objectives:**
- Create geographic narrative about a meaningful place
- Practice integrating maps with place-based storytelling
- Develop skills in place-based thinking and spatial communication

**Suggested Activities:**
- Have students conduct "geographic interviews" about their chosen place
- Ask them to map geographic characteristics (climate, culture, history, etc.)
- Encourage place-based photography and documentation
- Have peer reviews focusing on geographic clarity and accuracy

**Assessment Focus:**
- Does the story reveal geographic insights?
- Are maps appropriately chosen and annotated?
- Is geographic context clear?
- Does the narrative connect place to broader geographic concepts?

- Create professional-quality spatial communication
- Demonstrate capacity for geographic research and storytelling

**Suggested Activities:**
- Have students identify geographic research questions early
- Require data gathering (interviews, observations, datasets)
- Use peer feedback emphasizing geographic accuracy and insight
- Connect projects to local/regional geographic issues
- Share best projects with local geographic/planning communities

**Assessment Focus:**
- Geographic significance of chosen topic
- Quality of geographic evidence and analysis
- Clarity of geographic communication
- Ethical representation of place and people

## Teaching Strategies

### 1. Start with Geographic Questions
Rather than "What place do you want to show?" ask:
- "What geographic question do you want to explore?"
- "What spatial relationship do you want to reveal?"
- "How does geography shape this place or phenomenon?"

### 2. Emphasize Geographic Evidence
- Require students to support claims with data, maps, or observations
- Teach reading and interpreting geographic maps
- Connect visual evidence to geographic concepts

### 3. Connect to Place
- Encourage students to work with places they know or are learning about
- Value local geographic knowledge
- Connect small-scale place studies to broader geographic patterns

### 4. Teach Responsible Representation
- Discuss how places and people are portrayed
- Examine power dynamics in geographic communication
- Emphasize ethical, respectful storytelling

### 5. Make Geographic Thinking Explicit
- Use geographic vocabulary (spatial, scale, place, pattern, region, etc.)
- Ask geographic questions throughout
- Connect student work to geographic concepts and research

## Discussion Prompts by Module

### Module 1: Geographic Access
- How does access to geographic data democratize geography?
- What geographic information can you access with a free account?
- How do organizations share geographic knowledge?

### Module 2: Geographic Communication
- How do maps communicate differently than words?
- What geographic information gets lost in simple maps?
- When is a Sidecar better than a static map?

### Module 3: Place-Based Storytelling
- What makes a place geographically significant?
- How do geography and place meaning connect?
- What geographic knowledge exists in your community?

### Module 4: Geographic Research
- How do spatial stories communicate research better than papers?
- What geographic questions matter in your field?
- How can geographic storytelling engage communities?

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Students don't understand the geographic focus
**Solution:** 
- Ask "why is this place/phenomenon geographically important?"
- Show professional geographic projects
- Connect to visible local geographic phenomena
- Use geographic vocabulary consistently

### Issue: Maps aren't supporting the narrative
**Solution:**
- Review map annotation and labeling
- Discuss what geographic information the map should show
- Practice with Express Maps before complex Web Maps
- Ask "what geographic question does this map answer?"

### Issue: Geographic evidence is weak
**Solution:**
- Teach data literacy and source evaluation
- Point to Living Atlas and open data resources
- Require data integration in every section
- Have students cite geographic sources

### Issue: Projects feel disconnected from reality
**Solution:**
- Require field observations or interviews
- Connect to local geographic issues
- Have community members review projects
- Ask "so what?" about geographic findings
