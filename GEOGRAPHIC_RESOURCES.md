## Geographic Concepts & Terminology

### Spatial Concepts
- **Location:** Where something is (absolute: coordinates; relative: directions)
- **Scale:** Local → Regional → National → Global interconnections
- **Pattern:** Clustered, dispersed, or linear arrangement
- **Region:** Areas united by common characteristics
- **Space:** Relationship between places and phenomena

### Geographic Methods
- **Spatial Analysis:** Examining where and why things occur
- **Cartography:** Map making and geographic communication
- **GIS Analysis:** Geographic Information Systems analysis
- **Remote Sensing:** Using satellite/aerial imagery
- **Fieldwork:** Direct observation and data collection

### Geographic Themes
- **Human-Environment Interaction:** How people adapt to and modify environments
- **Place:** Unique characteristics and meaning of locations
- **Culture:** Values, beliefs, practices distributed across space
- **Economy:** Production, distribution, consumption systems
- **Political Geographies:** Territory, power, governance
- **Development:** Inequality and development patterns globally

## Building Your Geographic Project

### Step 1: Define Your Geographic Question
Ask yourself:
- What place or spatial phenomenon interests me?
- What geographic pattern am I exploring?
- What geographic knowledge will my story share?
- Who needs to understand this geography?

### Step 2: Gather Geographic Evidence
- Find relevant datasets and maps
- Conduct field observations/interviews if possible
- Collect images and media documenting the place
- Document your sources

### Step 3: Choose Your Geographic Narrative Structure
**Option A:** Location-Based
- Move through space (north to south, city to countryside, etc.)
- Use Sidecar for spatial progression

**Option B:** Thematic
- Organize by geographic themes (climate, culture, economy)
- Use chapters for each theme

**Option C:** Problem-Solution
- Pose geographic challenge
- Explore causes and solutions
- Use maps to show spatial relationships

**Option D:** Change Over Time
- Show how place has changed
- Use before/after comparisons
- Document geographic transformation

### Step 4: Design Your Geographic Communication
- Choose maps carefully (do they answer your geographic question?)
- Annotate maps to highlight key features
- Integrate images showing landscape characteristics
- Use text to explain geographic patterns
- Include data visualizations if relevant

### Step 5: Ensure Ethical Representation
- Research the place's history and context
- Represent communities respectfully
- Acknowledge different perspectives
- Avoid stereotypes or oversimplification
- Cite your sources

## Geographic Writing Tips for StoryMaps

### Be Specific About Place
❌ "The city has urban problems"
✓ "Downtown Portland's traffic congestion affects air quality in low-income neighborhoods northeast of the city center"

### Use Geographic Vocabulary
Use terms like: spatial, scale, pattern, location, region, place, landscape, distribution, adaptation, interaction, boundary, corridor, density

### Support Claims with Evidence
- Reference maps and data
- Connect to geographic concepts
- Show spatial relationships
- Use examples

### Connect Local to Global
- Show how local places connect to larger patterns
- Explain regional and global influences
- Help readers understand scale

### Write for Geographic Understanding
- Assume readers may not know the place
- Explain geographic context
- Use maps to show what you're describing
- Define geographic terms
